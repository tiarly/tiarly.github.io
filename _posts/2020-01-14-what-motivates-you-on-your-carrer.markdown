Hey everyone, I've recently being asked what did motivate me, and I actually gave a lot of thought into it, and these are the 10 most important things in my humble opinion:

**1. Creating something**

-   The ability to able to be always in a place or project that you have the opportunity to start new things, with new technologies and new patterns is very satisfying.

**2. Learning new Stuff and Evolving**

-   Being able to keep learning at all times, always focusing being a better version of yourself to really make a difference.

**3. Making a Work of Art**

-   Even though getting things done as fast as you can is surely a very nice thing, not only for you but for the company as well. But choosing a company that will allow you to choose  or have a say in the right approach, architecture, or even patterns to be used are definitely good because at the end of the day you will not only feel good for having completed something, but also will be proud of how you did it, and that’s make a hell of a difference.

**4. Challenges**

-   The ability to be away from a comfort zone is a MUST, and it’s on the keys to succeed in pretty much anywhere, and software development isn’t any different. So be in a place where you always going to be challenging yourself as much as you can!

**5. Aligning company goals to your own personal goals**

-   This is quite difficult nowadays because many people don’t know where they want to go or what they want to achieve. If you know what you want for yourself in the next couple of yours from now, just make sure your company would be able to help achieve that at same time you help them achieve theirs.

**6. Being appreciated**

-   Being appreciated by your employer is always important, because not only helps you make you on check on where you want to go, but also, at least for me, it feels like having it passed by a checkpoint where you have the confidence and proper feedback that things are being valued and thus will be appreciated accordingly.

**7. Fear of Getting Fired**

-   This goes into the place where you need to finding a place that will be a constant challenge environment that will be always keeping on the edge, not pressure, because this is something completely different, but will help you guide being a better developer every day, and yes, fear is always good to keep you on the alert for the unknown, so it’s not that bad having a little bit of that.

**8. Transparency**

-   This is always something that will help you make sure you going in the right path because it will always be able to be certain or know that will be allowed to know things in your department, without growing unknown questions and concerns that will just divide the team, and most of all, will start to make you feel discourage onto your daily tasks. That’s something you should always try to be as well as finding a company that will share the same principle.

**9. Working with awesome People**

-   There is a very good saying that will like to say to people that says: **you are the average of the top 5 people you surround yourself with.** That basically will mean that if you do not surround yourself with really good and amazing people the chances you have of getting out of that circle will be very low, and if you get out of it, you will very likely will be even further away from your goals or dreams. So always try to look for places where you will always have really good colleagues that will always be able to learn from and keep on growing, always.

**10. The Money**

-   And lastly, but not least important, money. Yes this is essencial and it goes directly related to how companies value their employees. It’s very important to know how much is the average value for your current position and also how much you can be able to gain in the coming future. Just being appreciated sometimes isn’t enough to keep good engineers on board, sometimes if you want the best you have to able to pay the price right? Always make sure to find a company that will try to do whatever it takes to keep you expanses problems as minimal as possible. Of course, as long as you deserve it right? But Transparency is very welcome here to help you discover that.

**So what motivates You?**
